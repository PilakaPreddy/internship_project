Client Server Communication using socket programming 

In this project under the guidance of my assigned manager and my mentor I have learned and experienced on how communication happens between client and server using socket. When it comes to programming I have used C language for writing the server and client .c codes.

with the help of uml diagram we can understand the architecture briefly on how communication establishes between client and socket.
